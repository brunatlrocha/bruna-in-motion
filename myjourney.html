    <div class="introduction">Hey folks! I'm Bruna, a full-stack web developer. I‚Äôve always loved working with technology and building things from scratch.

    <div class="development">Originally from Brazil, I moved to Canada to pursue my passion for web development. I have a background in Production Engineering, but my love for technology led me to switch careers. 
        Now, I‚Äôm focused on becoming a skilled full-stack developer.
    <div class="conclusion">In my free time, I like to explore new places, enjoy nature, and spend time with friends. I‚Äôm always curious and excited to learn new things, both professionally and personally.
        I‚Äôm looking forward to the opportunities ahead and can‚Äôt wait to see where this journey takes me!</div>
